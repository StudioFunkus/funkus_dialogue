# Contributing to Funkus Dialogue

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Funkus Dialogue! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Clone your fork locally
- Add the original repository as an upstream remote
- Create a new branch for your work

## Development Workflow

1. Make sure your main branch is up to date with upstream
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
3. Implement your changes
4. Write or update tests as needed
5. Ensure all tests pass with `cargo test`
6. Format your code with `cargo fmt`
7. Check for issues with `cargo clippy`
8. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message
9. Push your branch to your fork
10. Open a pull request against the main repository

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Fill in the required template
- Include screenshots or animated GIFs in your pull request if applicable
- Update documentation as needed
- Make sure your code passes all tests
- Keep your pull request focused on a single topic
- Be open to feedback and be willing to make changes to your pull request

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow semantic commit messages:
- `feat:` A new feature
- `fix:` A bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or tools

## Code Style

We follow standard Rust style guidelines:
- Use `cargo fmt` to format your code
- Follow idioms suggested by `clippy`
- Write descriptive comments for complex logic
- Include documentation comments for public API
